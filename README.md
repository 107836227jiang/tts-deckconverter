## Features

* Generate a Tabletop Simulator deck with thumbnail from an existing website or file.

* Import from the following website:

    * <https://scryfall.com>
    * <https://deckstats.net>
    * <https://tappedout.net>
    * <https://deckbox.org>
    * <https://www.mtggoldfish.com>
    * <https://www.moxfield.com>
    * <https://manastack.com>
    * <https://ygoprodeck.com>
    * <https://yugiohtopdecks.com>

* Import from the following files:

    * `*.dec`
    * `*.cod`
    * `*.ydk`
    * `*.ptcgo`

* Available as a command-line application and a GUI (built using [Fyne](https://fyne.io/)).

* Ability to customize the back of the cards.

* No external tool required. You just need to run the provided executable.

* MTG

    * Support for transform and meld cards. Implemented using [states](https://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/creating-states/) (press 1 or 2 to switch between states).

    * Sideboard and Maybeboard support.

    * Oversized card support (they'll appear twice as big as standard cards).

* Template mode

    By default, each card will have it's own image, retrieved from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), [YGOPRODeck](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/) or <https://pokemontcg.io/>. \
    It's also possible to create a [card sheet template](https://kb.tabletopsimulator.com/custom-content/custom-deck/) (like what [decker](https://github.com/Splizard/decker) is doing). The template can be uploaded to Imgur automatically, or you can upload it manually to an image hosting site and update the `FaceURL` values in the deck's JSON file.

## Supported platforms

* Windows 7 or later
* macOS 10.11 or later
* Linux 2.6.23 or later
